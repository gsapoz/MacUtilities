# Gary's Mac Utility Tools

Just a code dump of all the 5-minute OSX projects I've done to keep me a little more productive.
Everything is free of charge, developed from scratch, and strictly inspired by my imagination.


# Installation Instructions

* Clone the repository, or copy the source code from your desired directory
* Open your favorite SwiftUI project in xCode, press play (execute the script)
* The app will now live in your Applications folder until you delete it.

# Gary's Own Mac Utility Tools

This is just a code dump of all the 5-minute OSX projects I've done to boost my workflow and productivity.
Everything here is free of charge, developed from scratch, and strictly inspired by my imagination: 
I don't consider them complex apps, but they're certainly fun and very helpful. 
All of these projects are considered archived in my book, so they're locked from further contributions.
So all I can say now is ... enjoy!

# Installation Instructions

* Clone the repository, or copy the source code from your desired directory
* Open your favorite SwiftUI project in xCode, press play (execute the script)
* The app will now live in your Applications folder until you delete it. 

# App Descriptions

- flipclock: A minimalist clock widget inspired by vintage electromagnetic clocks from the late 1800s. Its roughly the size of a default OSX Terminal, and has the same aesthetic too, I typically leave it on for weeks, forgetting to turn it off, because the OSX clock on the top right corner of the screen is hard to read sometimes. This app is for all my fellow horopalettologists. 
- lavalamp: A pseudo-screensaver that uses an animated medley of LinearGradients, RadialGradients, and ZStack masks to try and mimic the a classic Lava Lamp. I use this strictly for aesthetic purposes, because I don't have a lava lamp in my bedroom office but I do have a lot of space on my monitor.
